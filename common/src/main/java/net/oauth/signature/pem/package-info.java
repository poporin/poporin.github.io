/**
 * Classes to handle cryptographic data in PEM formats of X509.
 * Partially extracted from the library distributed from net.oauth projectã€€at following location:
 *  http://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/code/java/core/commons/src/main/java/net/oauth/signature/pem/
 * Also a small modification is applied to the original code, and
 * Base64 decoder is substituted with one provided by commons-codec.
 * This change is applied so that this package can be used 
 * independently from other parts of this library.
